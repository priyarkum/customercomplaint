Necessary documents were submitted by XXXX. After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document.

03-04-2017,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"My wife and I visited the Chase Bank branch at XXXX, XXXX, KY on XX/XX/2017 around XXXX AM to open new checking accounts. We were prompted to open these checking accounts because Chase mailed and emailed us vouchers to receive {$300.00} for opening each account and personal friends had also referred us. XXXX was assigned to assist us in this matter. His first question to us was "" where do you work? "". After informing him that we are both were XXXX employees he asked us what we were going to do with our XXXX accounts. We advised him we would be keeping those accounts open. He then asked what we would be using our new Chase accounts for and I advised we would be using those accounts for miscellaneous savings, etc. It was then that XXXX XXXX advised he would not be opening the new accounts for us unless we closed our XXXX accounts and he tossed the Chase Voucher and our ID 's back across the desk to us ( RUDE! ). Confused, I questioned him further about this and he advised that he did not believe we were going to use our new Chase accounts and would just close them in 6 months. Upon clarifying that we would indeed keep the Chase accounts open and meet all of the requirements of the offer he stated that we would not be closing our XXXX accounts. He reiterated that he would not open the accounts for us and advised that he would get his manager XXXX involved. When XXXX XXXX arrived in the office to speak with us she advised that Chase would not be honoring the vouchers and would not open accounts for us because XXXX XXXX told her we were not planning to keep the accounts open and would not be "" using '' the accounts. I advised XXXX XXXX that we intended to meet the minimum requirements ( set up direct deposit and keep the account open for 6 months ) and would keep the accounts open further if we enjoyed the service we received from Chase during that time. I advised we intended to have direct deposit active on the accounts and would be moving money in and out of the accounts, but she did not seem to believe that was qualifying usage of the accounts. She then advised that I had previously opened a Chase account with a coupon about 10 years ago and did not keep it open. However, I believe that account was my primary checking account and I did keep it open for the required period of time and more. It was only when I moved out of state that I closed the account because I did not know if there would be Chase branches in my new area. I am deeply insulted by my experience in trying to open these new accounts and feel that my wife and I have been discriminated against because of our employment with another banking institute. In addition to this occurrence while my wife and I we waiting in the lobby to meet with XXXX XXXX we both were able to clearly observe XXXX 's business interactions with another customer who was in his cubicle/office which has an open door and clear glass windows. We were able to hear their entire conversation and at a certain point XXXX XXXX pulled that customer 's XXXX score. After pulling the XXXX score up on his monitor he swiveled the monitor around so that it was facing directly out the window into the lobby and I could clearly see the customer 's score was XXXX. Being in the banking business I understand well that this is a clear violation of Customer Confidentiality regulations and should be dealt with as such.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,KY,423XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-04-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2371744

04-12-2017,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"I have documentation that shows that US Bank would not charge a Returned Item Fee nor an Overdraft Fee on my account ( Number XXXX ). When a withdrawal or other debit came in and there were non-sufficient funds, the payment was returned, without charging any fees, unless the resulting overdraft amount was negligible ( This occurred seven times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on the old account as shown by notices received in the mail attached herein ). 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new account at US Bank ( XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, an overdraft fee was charged, and a few days later two other payments were returned, one other was returned and more fees were added. The Bank has failed to provide satisfactorily explanation of this change in policy. At the time of opening the new account, I was not given any notice or warning that new rules would apply. The Bank keeps adding extended overdraft fees. 
In my perception, the bank should have not honored any payments that were underfunded nor charged any fees for overdraft nor returned items because US Bank created a reasonable expectation through consistent behavior upon which reliance was reasonable. The Bank should bring the account to XXXX balance at its own expense. Further, the bank should refrain form a threatened charge off or any other report that will harm my credit history.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,CA,928XX,,Consent provided,Web,04-12-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2431565

They say it was their error but they should n't have deposited the money because that checking account has n't been used to pay a Chase fee within 3 months, so could n't be approved for the transfer.. I had XXXX balances so there was no need to make a payment. They made this decision after they deposited the money into my account.They say they will pay the bank fees but where am I supposed to get the XXXX?. I do not have all of the XXXX left and what is there is allocated for checks and payments that have not cleared yet. I accepted their offer and borrowed this money in good faith and have spent many hours on the phone with various Chase reps and am that the account is active, has XXXX available credit, but they can not assign the money already borrowed to that account because it was n't used for 3 months. Surely they can lift the rule to cover their error, but they wo n't. The woman, who said she was a manager, gave me the fax number of Chase Executive Offices as my only recourse.

This was surprise to me and the lease residual is at 49 % of the purchase price which the lease payment considered as a rent payment. I 've had leases with other banks and never experienced this before which each payment you make it does deduct from the purchase price.

I am requesting an investigation into whether my equity in my home has been used by my current loan company during my several requests for trying to negotiate ways to keep my home ... however, my equity has not been used to pay off my {$25.00}, 000 loan deficits. Why??????? 
Whether my income was low or high, the I never was within the 31 % bracket to obtain a new modification, Why????

04-04-2017,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"This is a complaint against First Hawaiian Bank for its grossly incompetent management of its supposedly new and improved website. I 've been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. 

Tonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to FHB Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer FHB Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But FHB never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. FHB displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with "" XXXX '' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the FHB site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the FHB site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site 's issues. 

There is obviously something seriously wrong with the FHB website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with FHB, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked. But I am far more concerned with FHB 's employees ' inability to troubleshoot, assist, or even acknowledge something is wrong.",Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers,"FIRST HAWAIIAN, INC.",VA,220XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,04-04-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2417043

No explanation for the change to my repayment plan was provided in the letter. I have made all the monthly payments on time since XX/XX/XXXX and have never been notified by NAVIENT that I was delinquent on any monthly payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX or that I owed any late fees.

03-04-2017,Credit card,,Delinquent account,,"Capital One reported my auto loan payments late several consecutive times. I have several credit cards with Capital One and all paid on time. Never late. I closed them because I noticed a pattern of discrimination. The higher my credit score went the more interest I paid. With my car loan, in XXXX, I was overpaying Capital One and caught them lying about what I owed. They repaired the issue. In the fall of XXXX they started overcharging me again, so I demanded they show proof. While I waited, they never disclosed their malfeasant actions toward me, they continued to mark me late. I researched all my credit reports and noticed they are all over the place, so I contacted all the XXXX and they informed me, they report only report what Capital One tells them, so why are the payments in different years and months??? Both Capital One and the Credit Bureaus, specifically XXXX stated it is ok and legal for them to be different because it happens all the time. I vehemently disagree for the following reason. 
Credit scores permeate our entire lives, and the Credit Bureaus must be accurate because credit scores impact our QUALITY OF LIFE and PROSPERITY. 
XXXXXXXX We need a good credit score to buy a home 2. A good score is needed to buy a car 3. Health Insurance premiums hinge on our credit score, not logical - it is criminal 4. Car Insurance uses our credit to offer us car insurance - it does not hinge on your driving record anymore, it depends on your credit score which is criminal. 
5. To rent an apartment - your credit score is used. 
6. Physicians are asking for credit report to obtain medical care - their reason - Dentist say, if you need major dental work, we must ensure your good for it. 
Credit Scores permeate our lives, so for Capital One, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to have such a casual attitude is dangerous. Our Federal Government must insert FINES and new REGULATIONS for Companies and Credit Reporting Agencies to ensure they are taking consumers credit reporting seriously. 
Please ask Capital One to remove the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX late payments off my credit reports. Thank you.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,CT,060XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-04-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2371615

Subsequently our account was locked for suspected fraud. We called Capital one verified our identity and the changes. Capital One requested supporting documentation from us consisting of drivers license copies, utility bills, and a copy of our Social Security card for each cardholder. We thought this an odd request especially since we have been using the card for over a year. We advised them that we were fine sending in everything with the exception of our Social Security card copies as we were not comfortable for security reasons with them having or storing a digital copy of our social security cards. We then sent in drivers license and utility bills for each card holder and with held the Social Security cards. For some reason After numerous calls Capital One refuses to remove the fraud hold on our card until we provide digital copies of our social security cards, which we will not do. This caused disruptions in our business so we opened another card with another company. 

We called Capital One to close our account due to the fact that we were at an impasse. At the time we had a balance of approximately {$560.00}. We had accrued {$510.00} in cash rewards using the card for the last year. We requested to use the cash rewards we had earned to close out the account and fund the balance. Capital One now refuses to let us use our cash rewards until we send in our social security cards. We paid the balance and it seems we will now loose our cash rewards because we refuse to let Capital One have a copy of our Social Security cards.

03-04-2017,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"In 2001, I enrolled in XXXX in XXXX, Colorado ( later moved to XXXX, Colorado ) for the XXXX program with XXXX servicing my loan. As you may or may not be aware, XXXX is now closed due to an investigation into fraudulent practices. When it came time to repay my loan with XXXX, I did so as directed. In doing so, I noticed many times that no matter when I made the payment, the next statement would show up showing I owed late fees. I attempted to pay early so that I would n't accrue late fees and still they would show up on the following months statement. Phone calls to XXXX were not helpful, if responsive at all. 
Later, the national recession hit and I got well behind on my loan. So much so that I had a garnishment put on my wages. XXXX, through Pioneer Credit Recovery, started me on what they called a rehabilitation program in order to bring my loans current. I finished the program and believed that my loan was current and that, as ( now ) Navient explained in their correspondence, all negative effects would be removed from my credit. However, apparently the rehabilitation program only affected my Federal loans and did not rehabilitate the past due private loans. These private loans still show as delinquent on my credit report. Navient made no attempt to inform me that the rehabilitation would n't repair my entire account. 
Each month, I pay {$150.00} through automatic payment to Navient. Yet with them still showing that loans are delinquent, my balance never goes down and my credit is in major disrepair.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CO,802XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-04-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2371880

The credit card company told me i had 560 days for a max extension to dispute from the date of transaction which would extend me to XX/XX/XXXX. The contractor had not installed the garage floor till XX/XX/XXXX due to his backlog. When garage floor was installed the credit card was already cancelled since i had paid the balance off. I anticipated issues due to history of contractors and ended up being correct. There was faulty workmanship discovered. I contacted Chase Ink to dispute and they "" purged '' my account just a few months later after it was closed. Sent a fax to the correspondence team ( only fax provided ) with no response yet my fax went via ( proof of sent/received time stamp ) .The customer service dept states once the account is purged there is nothing they can do about it. I have the right as a consumer to dispute and this purge now violates my rights for consumer protection. I have also sent a request to the Chase XXXX office.

02/23/2017,Payday loan,,Charged fees or interest I didn't expect,,"XXXX XXXX started calling all my family members about a payday loan I had with Advance America. They never sent any letters or contacted me directly. My mother received a voice mail from a XXXX XXXX. Once they got in touch with my mother we called them back to get a clear understanding of what they were calling about. We talk to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so he said. Once we began the conversation, he explained that a company sent my paper work to their Law Firm. We asked him several times who did the payday loan come from and after a while he told us Advance America. Next he went on to say I owed {$960.00}. I told him that did not sound right, because I had not borrowed that much from anyone. He said that included what I owed Advance America with fee 's. Next he asks if I wanted to pay this amount today and my mother interrupted him and asked for for a settlement amount. He gave the amount of XXXX. I asked him several times, why was n't I notified by mail and he never gave an explanation. Next I told him I was going to call Advance America and he said "" IT 'S NOT GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO REFER YOU BACK TO US. '' So what I did to get him off the phone is to tell him to email me the paper work for what I owe and told him I would pay it, but I was n't. I then contacted Advance America about my account and found out I only owed {$110.00}. I gave them the company name that was trying to get all this money out of me and they had never heard of them. Advance America gave me the number to the people that they said they sold my acct. to. They told me they sold my account on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They gave me the number to the company they sold it to and it was not XXXX, so I thought. Once I called XXXX different numbers it led my back to XXXX under a different name. They were operating under XXXX different names, as a Legal company. When the answering machine picked up to my surprise it was XXXX, the company Advance America said they knew nothing about. At this point XXXX called me back on XXXX/XXXX/2017 and told them I found out my balance from Advance America, so he made another offer of {$200.00}. I told him no, I was not paying what I did n't owe. I did tell him I would pay the {$110.00} if they sent me another settlement letter. They never sent another XXXX. Today is XXXX/XXXX/2017 and they have not called or mailed or emailed anything. These people are scammers and must be closed and stopped. They threaten to garnish my pay check, without being sued or going to court. Told me I would be criminally charged. These messages were left on my mother phone by a person named XXXX XXXX and she also called my uncle and sister telling him the same things. XXXX XXXX made the same threats. These people called everyone in your family that they can contact. This is a tacked used to embarrass you, so their intended victim calls them and they can scare you into paying them extortion money. They work in teams, XXXX pretending to be the server, and the other pretending to be the verification person and another person pretending to be the Attorney name they use when they talk to you and send out settlement letters, which is XXXX XXXX Attorney at Law. Please stop these people and the Attorney that 's involved in this madness. By the way XXXX has a F rating with the BBB and the Attorney has aN A rating. Go figure.

I then went to get my credit report from online and saw a bankruptcy and judgement that I have no knowledge of whatsoever. I then went to file a police report, I sent documents including my FTC affidavits and dispute letters which I sent to the alleged creditors and it appears they are in some kind of ponzi scheme or false deception against the people to not disclose valid information or not investigate validate any proof verified and signed by a witness of a notary. The reporting agencies are not following lawful procedure. The information being reported is not accurate information. I have been a victim of fraud and contacted the FTC all these illegal actions are hurting me and my family.

03-05-2017,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"I attended the XXXX which is located in XXXX, PA in XXXX of XXXX. I attended a class for XXXX months and finished in XXXX of XXXX. Which I believe this vocational/technical school no longer exists. Anyhow I had taken out a student loan with XXXX which is now navient. At first I was making payments towards my loan efficiently via mail and electronic on their website. But something did seem off now that this lawsuit against them has been filed. Thinking back while making my payments, every time I have received a bill, the amount seemed like I owed more, and the payments I was making did n't seem like they were taking effect with the balance of my amount due. At a point with making payments I declared a forebenece. In which I couldnt make payments because I was not working at the time and it was granted for 3 months. After 3 months I still was n't in the working field so they granted me with another 3 months of forebenece. After 6 months I have n't not received any type of letter or information regarding my loan. Then after a few years when XXXX converted into navient, I then received a letter regarding the conversion of the companies, but no information regarding my student loan and the amount I still owed. Maybe a few months to a year later I still did n't receive anything about my account, I then tried to log into my account online on their website. Since it has been awhile since I logged onto my account at this time I had to reset my password and everything. When I was trying to do so and providing the information that was needed, it kept telling me that there was no record of my information and I had no account. I believe this happened in XXXX I may be wrong. At this point I still havent received any information regarding my account until last year XXXX. I started receiving phone calls at random times of the day which I could n't answer due to being at work and everytime I did try and call back the office was closed. They basically were harassing me via phone but yet did not send anything via mail. Until they did send me a letter in the mail threatening me that they were going to be taking me to court or take a percentage out of my paycheck if I did n't make a payment. Still I had no information of how much I still owed. Then I did contact them via phone I set up a payment plan I started paying however I was not recieving a bill, receipts or anything. All I had was a phone number to make a payment. After a payment of {$260.00} I had made, I sensed that something was n't right so I did n't make another payment. Even with my first payment I have not received a receipt or any bill for my remaining balance. Now that I am working this company had found out what company I am working for and is taking a percentage out of my check that I work very hard for. Still till this day I have not received any type of letter regarding my account balance that 's due. Now just 2 weeks ago I filed my XXXX tax return. Today I just received a letter stating that this company will be interfering with my tax return payment. Which I am very highly upset, because I am very well depending on my tax return check for other personal reasons. For them to interfere with what I worked so hard for for a lousy company that is terrible for NOT sending any type of information about my account is disgraceful.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",PA,191XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-05-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2371682

I had to contact XXXX to request this letter from them then send the letter over to experian to have this information corrected and now they are reporting it again in accounts that are potentially negative and should go to a positive status in the year XX/XX/XXXX. I just tried to dispute this information again with experian but the system would not allow me to do so. I am submitting this complaint about experian credit reporting agency because they are affecting my credit score by re-inserting an account into negative when I provided substantial proof to them that this account should be listed under "" ACCOUNTS THAT ARE IN GOOD STANDING ''. I never had a late payment with mandee 's credit card so the information experian is reporting on my credit report is wrong.

They withdrew the funds and verified this via email. In addition, I checked my account the verified that the funds had been withdrawn. Once that was completed, I was given the information to set up online. I did that by creating a user name and password. I was told that the funds would not be available for 2- 3 days and I would receive a debit card in 7-14 business days. Again, this communication was via email. I logged into my account via the web on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, I received an email stating that my user access had been disabled. There was no indication on the email as to why it had been disabled. However, the email stated that, "" If you believe this change was made in error, or if you have further questions, please contact ... '' I contacted the number in the email 3 times. The first call was answered but I had been on hold for nearly 10 minutes before a representative answered the line. By that time, I had to go ( I was on a break at work ). I called in the afternoon and waited 30 minutes on hold before hanging up. Finally, later that day, I was able to speak with a representative. Her name was XXXX and I explained to her from the beginning that I did not have the account number. This was because this information was not given in an email ( I understand completely ) and I had not received any written documentation at the time. She said that was fine and she would be able to verify me in other ways. Which she did. Once that was completed, she placed me on hold and said that more documentation was needed. She told me what information was needed and where to email it. During this interaction, I began to feel as if I was getting the run around. The representative told me they had not received payment from me. I explained to her that her company sent emails stating they had received funds. In addition, the funds were taken from my account. I began to feel uneasy and told her I wanted to cancel the accounts and receive a refund. I asked to speak with a supervisor. She placed me on hold and said that a supervisor would call me back in 48 hours. I questioned this because it was Thursday evening. I asked her if they made calls on the weekends and she said they did. On Friday, XXXX XXXX, I emailed the required documentation to BBVA and requested that the accounts be closed and I receive a refund immediately. I later received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that they had received my information and that my information had been forwarded it to 'corporate investigations ' for review but my concerns have not been addressed by this bank ( why the online access was disable and why they show they had received no funds ).

03-05-2017,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"I had a vehicle loan that was opened by a dealership on my behalf with Chase vehicle loans. I set up my account to automatically pay the bill every month through the Chase website from my Chase checking account. I paid this loan off early, this process closed my chase auto loan account and shut off access to it ( which makes sense you should n't need access to it ). My issue is that the automatic bill pay continued to draw the standard payment from my checking account after the account was closed. When I called Chase they informed me that I had to go into my account to cancel the automatic payments however since the account was closed I obviously could not do so. After an hour or so talking to various help desks they were able to cancel future payments to the closed account however the {$640.00} that they had drawn from my checking account was not returned. The Chase representative said it would take 20 business days to return the funds to my account. As Chase requires that their customers cancel recurring payments on accounts that they can not access and then bars customers access to their own funds, I believe that this would fall under the category of deceptive or unfair behavior.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,606XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-05-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2371663

The correspondence also reports that I need to pay to have it removed from my credit report but what is interesting is that it is not on any of my credit reports which made me even more suspicious of this situation.These people are threatening to sue me and place a judgement on my account and wage garnishment as scare tactics which has to be illegal as I truly believe these to be false claims.If I supposedly owed this from XXXX then why in XXXX would they suddenly attempt to collect a so called debt that they claim I owe?

The first shipping bottles was sent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and I received the XXXX package after 3 long weeks of waiting which I finally received by mail service on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( if she was sent by XXXX or XXXX I can received package early and less damage because package was lay around and less handle careful .... ), after I opened the package I smelled a scent of liquor which turns out was leaking from the bottle along with a label was stain with damage. At which point I decided to take pictures of it, I sent a notice to her and told her I would like to return it. It is apparent and obvious that the bottle was leaking prior her selling it to me. I tried to communicate with her to return it or credit me for damaged bottle. But she stated and told me old stuff may leak or stain ... that is normal for old stuff ... but I told her ... not for me and I do not buy damage goods. I just want return it! I have done some research to try and return it by XXXX or XXXX to send back to her. But liquid goods that leak are not permitted to send back, if the carrier smell or see something leaking they will destroy on site. It is a waste of my time and money, I received another package on XXXX XXXX, XXXX after 6 weeks and I did not open up because I knew should it be damaged due to the postal service, I would be stuck with yet another leaky bottle ( cheap shipping package lay around so long and not handling careful ... return with receipt from XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
I was advice from my credit card ( Capital One Master Card ) return Items to the seller ( and I had receipt I was sent back ) I did not get credit back to my credit and I also sent all back up pictures and dowload the document to credit card link on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and fax on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and now my credit charge back to my credit card ... even I was return stuff back to seller & credit card I had insurance to protection to buy I tried to get second pinion/ appraisal for the bottle that was damage but I can not find any companies around in XXXX County , Virginia to do so. I even went as far as to going to pawn shop to ask for a second opinion. Which I had no success for various reasons and them thinking it was some kind of law enforcement operation or sting ( in Virginia only XXXX stores are allowed to sell hard liquor ). I will also be discussing with my credit card company. I can bring the goods to your office to see. ( Capital One headquarters is in XXXX XXXX not too far from my house ).

04/16/2017,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Communication tactics,Threatened to take legal action,"I had XXXX service for television, internet, and phone in a townhome I owned in XXXX. I sold that property to move into a XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, IA. I contacted Moving Matters, a moving company that specializes in moving seniors into retirement communities. They pack, help downsize, and their designers set up your apartment in the community. I had a cable box, modem and all the hookups needed for the above service. I assumed it was all packed and taken to the XXXX. I checked with the moving company and they said their records showed all items moved as promised. However they told me I would not have needed a cable box at XXXX as the cable was sourced through XXXX. If a resident had a flat screen no cable box was needed. I know I was using the same modem as I used in XXXX or one very similar. ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) I lived at XXXX very close to a year and for personal reasons decided not to stay after my grace period of 365 days. In all the time I lived there I was never asked about the cable box or any of the equipment issued to me in XXXX. I still maintained the internet and phone so XXXX had my address and contact information. 

I had lived in XXXX for at least four or five months when I got my first collection letter. This letter was my first knowledge of this debt. 
Date XX/XX/XXXX ; Original Creditor-XXXX ; Account # XXXX I have the Modem ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) in question and a HDMI cable that is XXXX 's I think. I do n't know what happened to the cable box from XXXX. Common sense tells me it was in my apartment when XXXX set up my XXXX system. I was not missing anything other possessions that I had marked for the moving company. 

I have several problems with this claim. 

1. If it is customary to return these items and the information I received with the present system made it clear that is the case, why was I not asked for the XXXX Cable box, Modem and other hardware when I left XXXX? 

2. What was used to hook up my system in XXXX? I would like to see the records of the installation in XXXX to check the Serial # of the modem used against the serial # of the modem installed in XXXX. 

3. Did the installers see the XXXX cable box when they hooked up XXXX. XXXX has assured me that XXXX does all the installation. 

XXXX only handles the equipment they use to distribute the signal. So their technicians would not been involved in my apartment set up. 

4. Why was I not notified of this debt before it got to collection?",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Credit Protection Association, L.P.",IA,501XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,04/16/2017,Closed with explanation,No,No,2437352

All representatives of XXXX sat in an office as we presented documents in order to process said documents. The intent of visit was clearly stated. Calls were made to confirm if the papers submitted were in process there was one document that needed to be changed and we retrieved the needed document. The Personal Banker said that, "" It 's a go '' indicating we were ready to exchange on the promissory note. 
Then representatives of XXXX came in on Friday, XX/XX/2017, He attempted to open a business and savings account, which we did not request and, avoiding the very reason we came into the branch, which was to exchange legal tender ( promissory note ). We explained our intent and he then referred us to another Banking institution of Wells Fargo to speak with someone who dealt with our particular financial needs. We then, met with the Personal Banker 's, referal and then he explained that they do honor promissory notes as legal tender, negotiable instruments. He said we ca n't use our promissory note but Wells Fargo creates their own promissory note. We were then directed to corporate at Wells fargo. Several other calls were made to the corporate offices in California, one in XXXX and the other in XXXX XXXX, in attempts to exercise our rights regarding the promissory note according to the UCC law which is under the Federal Reserves and Maritime Law. [ Admiralty law or maritime law is a distinct body of law that governs maritime questions and offenses. It is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities, and private international law governing the relationships between private entities that operate vessels on the oceans ]. There were 2 of the 3 callers that were very rude and unprofessional and absolutely hateful and mean, when asked questions regarding their position and if we could speak to someone else in a higher position. We got blown off and talked to as brutes, just overall violated our constitutional and civil rights and turned away without the anticipated services rendered that are due us. The corporate office representatives told us they do n't do promissory notes but two branch manager told us they do them and have done them. We have an actual recording of the conversation with one of the managers telling us that he has done several promissory notes and that Wells Fargo create their own ( PN ) on a certain type of paper.

The use of fictitious names or addresses ( ALL CAPITAL LETTERS XXXX in a private individual 's name, or a ZIP CODE, against the individual 's wishes, is a crime under Title 39 U.S.C.

GLOSSA meaning ; written by supreme court judge XXXX, 3. There are two reference books called similar names ( sound familiar? ) -- - One is the XXXX, a popular style guide used widely by newspapers and other publications to provide uniform guidelines and standards for reporters and other writers ; it is a large reference book similar to a dictionary or thesaurus. The other is The XXXX, with an "" s '' which is a much smaller and more limited publication the size of a larger format paperback book, that deals with the subject of "" styles '' or "" stiles '' ( British ) exclusively. The most recent edition I can find is 1948, though there may be more recent editions. 
Both of these publications adequately explain what the Glossa is, as does Black 's Law Dictionary. The earlier versions of the American Bar Association guides to legal style and usage also plainly state that the use of all capital letters denotes either a corporation or a dead man 's estate. 

also by judge XXXX ; XXXX = a living American endowed with all his natural rights XXXX XXXX a foreign situs trust used in commercial shipping XXXX = a foreign estate trust XXXX XXXX a public transmitting utility company XXXX XXXX a public foundation XXXX XXXX a cooperative XXXX = a boat or ship used in public commerce XXXX = a commonwealth trust XXXX = a slave owned by XXXX XXXX = a foreign pauper forbidden to own land XXXX = a taxpayer XXXX = a soldier XXXX = a slave There are dozens of different potential meanings that can be arbitrarily assigned to anyone 's name and used to "" represent '' radically different entities.

03/31/2017,Mortgage,Other mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I have been a victim of fraud. Back in XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from Wachovia about refinancing my mortgage, it seem like a very good idea, since I was in a pick a payment loan with a negative amortization. We decided to take Wachovia 's offer and refi. They they told me that it would be a better idea to modify my mortgage. I was on the phone for about an hour, providing them with all the necessary information. They told us that it would take 2 to 4 weeks before we would get modified, 3 weeks went by, since I did not hear anything from Wachovia, I decided to call them for an update. finally I spoke to a representative ( XXXX ) and he told me that I was missing some documents. ( bank statements ) I told him that I had faxed over the bank statements 3 weeks ago. 
Neatness to say I faxed over the documents again, by then my mortgage was due, so asked XXXX, do I pay my mortgage or do I wait for you to call me. He said that I was modifying and I did not need to pay the mortgage, it was going to be added on to the new mortgage. but I did need to keep continuing paying my 2nd mortgage. 
By XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter for Wachovia stating that I did not pay my mortgage. And I could be facing foreclosure. I immediately call Wachovia about this letter. The funny thing about Wachovia, I could NEVER get the same person on the phone. Now, they told me that I was missing documents, ( most recent pay-stubs ) now I started to certify all letters to Wachovia and fax them also. 
By XX/XX/XXXX. I received another letter in the mail, this time it said that I was going into foreclosure, by now we had enough of this, so I called Wachovia to tell them that I did not want to participate in there games, and that I needed my original loan! until they said that I own them {$18000.00}. How can I owe you that much in 3 months! When my mortgage was only {$1600.00}. a month. 
By now I was very scared, so Wachovia left me with no choice but to continue with this nightmare Again they asked me for more documents, by now there was no way out for me and my family, Wachovia was running the show and we had no control of our life 's. but we wore still paying our 2nd mortgage. 
I spoke to so many Wachovia representative, ( have a record of ) every month they would ask me for the same things. I have {$470.00} of certified letters. It was always something they need it, but the funny part about it, they would never call me, I would ALWAYS have to call them, and of course, I would never talk to same person! 
This nightmare went on for over a year, by now my credit was ruined, the humiliation from our families and friends was too much to bear, people would knock on our door all day long. Take pictures of our house. so our marriage was also ruined. I suffered XXXX. 

At this time Wells Fargo took over Wachovia, and now I was dealing with Wells Fargo In XX/XX/XXXX I was finally approved. They gave me 40 YEARS ON MY MORTGAGE. I only had 24 yrs left, now I have 40 yrs. THANK YOU Wells Fargo. 

To this day my credit was ruined, and Wells Fargo refuses to work with me on fixing my credit, it took them 13 months to get an answer on a modification that I had no control of.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",NJ,070XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/31/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2413184

Posted on XX/XX/2014 by XXXX The United States CONSCRIPTED -- that is, borrowed -- an interest in everything that we would ever do and create -- a "" usufruct '' relationship where our interest and the ownership of every thing within our estate transferred over to them ; and they never gave their control of our property back to us. They have no lawful right to any of it, and no valid claim to us, our land, our businesses, our children, or any other asset of ours. 

These thieves are pretending that we consented to this circumstance and "" volunteered '' to subject ourselves to the United States jurisdiction "" for the War Effort '' in a war that has been over almost a hundred years. 

The expenses that they are responsible for are the expenses of all the shill legal fiction entities that they have created and run "" in your name '' by abusing the right of usufruct. Those expenses include the expenses and debts of the federal "" State '' foreign situs trust doing business as "" XXXX '' and the XXXX ESTATE trust doing business as "" XXXX '' and the XXXX transmitting utilitydoing business as "" XXXX '', and so on ad infinitum. 

What they create, they control -- and they are obligated to pay for what they create and control. The ones with the gold pay the bills! 

USUFRUCT : A right to use another 's property for a time without damage or diminishing it, although the property might naturally deteriorate over time. A legal usufruct is one created by law. A 100 year encumbrance -- XXXX 7th, page 1542. 

Because of this "" usufruct '' relationship the United States has the hidden obligation and lawful responsibility to maintain everything we think we own. We were promised that on demand, but were never taught how to access it. The system made a promise that they could not and did not keep. We need to stop claiming ownership of everything we think we own and revert our interest back to the United States so they can put it in a trust for us ( which they may have already done ) so they can settle our claims. 

Our signature turns a piece of paper into a negotiable instrument because we are financial institutions considered to be estates patented under land patent because we come from the earth. They patented a "" usufruct '' interest in us. We are all agricultural beings, commodities. When you buy a house you 're not buying a house, you are creating a loan against yourself, you become the collateral for the loan. The land patent can not go to ground because its immovable. 

You are considered in law -- the international law of the XXXX -- as Liebercode Entities "" outside of '' and "" foreign '' to the United States. 

We 're our own estate on our debtor side, and considered to be a financial institution, so when you put your signature on any piece of paper you are considered to be a bank. They just take a piece of paper and overlay it on your signature, and write on that piece of paper, on top of your signature, your signature that authorizes a transaction that you never see. 

Then they place a lien against that signed piece of paper and sell it as a security on the stock exchange. This is what they 're doing with child support. They have you sign something so they can slap a lien on it and then sell it as notes no longer with them, a counterfeit security anyway, as there is nothing backing it and they 've obtained it through fraud, so they are anxious to put the obligation onto someone else so it relieves them of the obligation, becau",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",FL,330XX,,Consent provided,Web,03/22/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2399149

03/27/2017,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I worked hard and rebuilt my credit and saved money so that I could buy a home for my family with an FHA mortgage loan. My problem is that the mortgage company that holds my FHA loan Wells Fargo is not giving us a fair chance to resolve missed payments. They have given us conflicting information, told us after a review that we qualified but then later told us we do not, and advised us to miss payments so that we would qualify for help. We are now being told by Wells Fargo that there are no options except a short sale or deeding the house back to them -- but we just made two large lump sum payments in the last few months and they accepted these payments. How can we be in this situation? It does not make sense. I have enough income to afford the monthly payment, but was injured at work and out for a few months which is how this downward spiral started. 

In XXXX 2016 I hurt XXXX on my job as a XXXX ( been doing it for 27 years ) and found out that I had some XXXX and XXXX. I was out of work for three months, and even though I had some money saved fell behind one mortgage payment. My wife tried to call in to make the missed payment but Wells Fargo said we could not do that ; we could only pay the current month 's payment and would then be responsible for late fees. We were not able to get ahead because the way my business works I have to buy all the materials for a job in advance and then recoup this money when I get paid at completion. We called in to Wells Fargo to see if there were any programs to help us get caught up and spoke with XXXX at Wells Fargo. She went over our loan, our situation and our financial information and XXXX said that we qualified for help, but that we needed to be at least "" 3 months behind '' to qualify for these programs. At that time it was helpful for me to have extra money from missing two more payments so we followed her advice and then called in to apply after we were three months behind. We went over everything on the phone and once again were told we qualify and that all we had to do was send in the paperwork, which Wells Fargo said they would mail out. Of course they never sent it, and we actually had the paperwork sent to a Wells Fargo branch where we picked it up. 

We sent it to XXXX who told us she would have an answer for us in two weeks. We waited nearly two months, and were then told that we were denied and that we either had to short sale the house or give the house back to the bank. We were in shock. How was this possible?? 

I am not sure what programs we were reviewed for by Wells Fargo but XXXX XXXX had led us to believe it was Save your Home California. It appears this is a program offered by the state of California. Wells Fargo has government and internal modification programs available -- additionally, this is a government insured FHA loan. I am pretty sure that Wells Fargo is REQUIRED to consider us for modification, partial claim, forbearance agreement or repayment plan. It appears they did not review us for ANY of these programs. 

We make enough money to afford our mortgage payment. We have made two large lump sum payments to Wells Fargo ( that they ACCEPTED ) over the last 3 months to cut down our delinquency, yet Wells Fargo is telling us we have to give back our house while they take our payments??

THEY HAVE NO VALID CONTRACT WITH LAWFUL ELEMENTS OF CONTRACT,!!! THEIR RESPONSE IS TOTAL XXXX!!! TOTAL NONSENSE!!! 

SHOW ME A CURRENT VALID CONTRACT WITH MY WET INK SIGNATURE!!! 
SHOW IT TO ME!!!! AND STOP XXXX AROUND WITH YOUR TACTICTS OF CRIMINAL DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR, THAT AINT MY XXXX DEBT AND YOU KNOW IT!!! 

PARTS OF A LAWFUL CONTRACT 1. Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 
2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 
3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 
4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 
5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 
6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 
7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. 
8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties.

03-05-2017,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Condensed description : My wife XXXX and I married in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX already had XXXX child, whose father was deceased. XXXX had her own XXXX and was doing well. She was making about {$XXXX} annually while I had a salary of about {$XXXX} a year. 
We soon bought a house ( XXXX ), Not long after that, XXXX 's father died. Rather than leave XXXX 's mother living alone on a country road some distance from our house, XXXX and I, in XX/XX/XXXX, bought a two-family house ( XXXX ) just XXXX short blocks from our house. XXXX 's mother and we would be within walking distance of each other. XXXX 's mother would live in the downstairs unit of XXXX and we would rent out the upstairs unit. 
XXXX and I spent some time and money improving the house. Then, unexpectedly and before XXXX 's mother could move in, XXXX 's mother died.. 

With XX/XX/XXXX came the financial crisis, dubbed "" The Great Recession. '' XXXX 's XXXX dropped precipitously and we had trouble finding renters for XXXX. XXXX had to close her business. We then had only my salary as income and XXXX mortgages and XXXX children. I applied for a mortgage modification on XXXX, but was turned down. We could find no tenants for XXXX, so it was vacant. Squatters soon moved into each apartment. 
I took the upstairs squatter to housing court to get her ordered out of the house, but the judge believed the lies that she and some tradesmen ( her friends ) told under oath. He ruled that she would be allowed to stay there until she had lived out, in rent, the approximately {$5900.00} that she claimed to have spent on repairs. 

XXXX developed a XXXX medical problem. 
XXXX put XXXX in my name only and then declared bankruptcy. That delayed foreclosure on XXXX for XXXX little while, but in XX/XX/XXXX, we received an eviction order at XXXX. 

I decided to try to get the squatters out of XXXX, so that we, now with XXXX children, would have a place to live after the eviction from XXXX. 
By my paying for a month 's worth of storage space for the XXXX squatter 's furniture and by my physically moving her furniture and other belongings, she agreed to leave the premises. 
That night, the night before our eviction was to take place, I. with help from a few relatives, managed to move our most essential belongings into the lower apartment of XXXX. Much had to be left behind, including appliances and food supplies. 

After our living in XXXX for a few weeks, I managed to get an eviction order for the upstairs squatter. Within two weeks she had moved out, doing only fixable damage in the process. That meant that our family 's space had doubled, so that each child could have a bedroom. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a mortgage modification from our mortgage holder, Ocwen. I hoped that Ocwen would rather receive a smaller monthly payment ( than the originally agreed-upon amount ) instead of none ( the amount they were receiving while the squatters were there. I was wrong. I was told that the company "" does not do modifications. '' I live in fear of being evicted from this house and can not afford to make needed repairs ( to upstairs hot-water-heating, upstairs space-heating, and roof ) if I am going to have to move soon.

03-05-2017,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"On XX/XX/2017, I made a {$1000.00} credit card payment to my student loan provider, Navient ( ex XXXX ) and asked the customer service rep. to cover the total amount due ( {$580.00} ) and apply the amount left over ( {$410.00} ) to a specific loan, since that loan has the highest interest rate ( 4.25 % ) and it 's the smallest loan. Mysteriously, the amount left over was not applied to that loan, but rather to the largest loan ( {$32000.00} ) I have with the highest interest rate ( 4.25 % ). 
I pointed out the problem from XX/XX/2017 to another rep. on XX/XX/XXXX and she told me that the reallocation of {$410.00} from the highest loan to the smallest loan would be processed by XX/XX/2017. 
I messaged Navient 's live online messaging service on XX/XX/XXXX to explain the problem and the rep. told me that they were looking into it and that it should be reallocated by the following week. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to yet again follow up and also make another payment, but nothing regarding the misallocation from XX/XX/2017 had been done. I received no correspondence regarding this matter. I pointed out the problem to another rep. this time and he told me that the reallocation of {$410.00} from the smallest loan to the largest loan would be processed at the latest by XX/XX/2017. 
On XX/XX/2017, I called yet again regarding situation from XX/XX/2017 and also to make a further payment. I explained the situation to yet another rep. and received his permission to record our conversation, and then made a payment with him. After the payment, he transferred me to a manager, XXXX. He denied me permission to record our conversation. I was very distraught and explained to him why I was upset. I then threatened legal action and to write a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if I did n't receive some form of written correspondence telling me they were dealing with the situation by the end of that day. He acted tough and told me that the "" Monetary Department '' dealt with these matters and that no one from that department was in. I was on the telephone for 2 hours as both he and and the other rep. put me on hold "" looking '' for someone. 
After that phone call, the situation turned extremely weird. When I went to log into my online Navient account an hour later, the access was denied and I had to "" re-register '' with a new login-name and password. After re-registering, I noticed that, although I made a payment on that day ( XX/XX/2017 ) totaling {$700.00}, that sum was also never applied to my loans and the amount of my smallest loan actually increased by {$240.00} ; my payment "" disappeared '' and I have no idea what the increased amount of {$240.00} is. What happened here? 
Even though I CONTINUOUSLY call and ask for clarification, my requests are met with a lack of accountability and customer service representatives who seem to lie about my situation. I want to know where my money went and why more money has been added to one of my loans. 
I can prove all of this, since I record all correspondence and take before and after screenshots of my payments.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",MD,227XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-05-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2372286

Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 
2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 
3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 
4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 
5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 
6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 
7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. 
8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties.

02/28/2017,Credit card,,Customer service / Customer relations,,"We have had a checking account with Wells Fargo ( formerly Wachovia ) for nearly 15 years, during our last visit to the XXXX branch we were persuaded to take out a credit card which would 'even out expenses over the year '. I had to make a deposit of {$300.00} and was charged {$25.00} for the annual fee. When the card arrived I had a credit limit of {$300.00}, being the sum I paid in, which makes it a pre-paid account in my view. I have tried unsuccessfully for weeks to sort out the return of my {$300.00} and the closure of the account. 
I spoke to their customer services two weeks ago and said I wanted to return the {$300.00} to my checking account and close the credit card account. As I had a bill to pay I needed it straight away and so said I would take it as a cash advance and the chap said the 3 % fee would be waived and the account would be closed, using the collateral account to pay the cash advance amount. 

I logged on my account today to see that the credit card account is still active with a balance of {$310.00} and a payment of {$40.00} overdue.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",,,,Consent provided,Web,03-02-2017,Closed with monetary relief,No,No,2365608

As XXXX explains, the full capitalization of the letters of one 's natural name, results in a diminishing or complete loss of legal or citizenship status, wherein one actually becomes a slave or an item of inventory.

04-06-2017,Credit card,,Advertising and marketing,,"Signed up for an XXXX from Bank of America for the benefits XX/XX/XXXX. Received a reduced priced companion fare voucher as advertised, took a while to show up in the account. I was going to use the voucher issued to me before the expiration dateI logged in and noted it expired in XX/XX/XXXX. I was ready to purchase the tickets and suddenly the voucher was gone. 
I called XXXX, they said it had expired on the date of my anniversary XXXX, I was bummed, but when I asked, "" then where is the new voucher '' noting that it clearly states that you will receive a new voucher "" on the date of your account anniversary ''. They said to call Bank of America to see when it would arrive. 
I called Bank of America spoke with XXXX and XXXX and was told it indeed had expired. I said OK then, while I was pretty sure it had not, then where is the new voucher? I was told that "" it was issued on XXXX, but it takes some time to process into your account '' and it would be there next month on "" XXXX ''. I tried to verify what I was hearing that there was a voucher that has been issued but I do not have access to it until it is processed into my account. Which would mean it would expire in 12 months from issue and that I would be missing out on 1 months use. They said yes, I asked to escalate the issue as I did not see how this was correct and wanted access to the voucher that they said has been issued sooner. I explained that this appears to be an issue of false advertising, and that it appears that Bank of America and XXXX could be benefiting to the tune of millions of dollars by reducing the odds of the benefit being used for 1 month, for each of their millions of customers, year over year. 
Plus, I happen to know the 1 month to process a voucher code into an account is untrue. Based on the working with an online store that deals with vouchers, I understand what the process consists of. Technically speaking if they run a chron job to remove expired vouchers from accounts daily, they also could also be running daily chron job to deliver vouchers daily. It is not a manual process by any means. 
A week goes by and I called back to find out what happened to the escalation as I had not been called back. They asked me to explain my issue. I told them my escalation number and asked them to explain to me, what the issue was escalated. The Rep read the report and said that they had escalated to get my old voucher re-instated and that they had validated that the voucher did indeed expire and closed the complaint. I asked to speak with her supervisor, and was then speaking with Supervisor "" XXXX ''. We discussed the issue and she then said that the voucher would arrive on XXXX, and through the course of the conversation told me that my account had been credited with the voucher the day after I applied for the card on XX/XX/XXXX. She then proceeded to argue that the advertisement was in incorrect and that the terms and conditions state the voucher can be delivered 1-2 billing cycles after the anniversary date because of processing time. We discussed the issue of false advertising and she blamed XXXX telling me to take it up with them as to why it takes a month. I suggested that there must be an SLA agreement that you are legally bound to and that if you are advertising a benefit to a product and are not actually delivering it then there should be penalties. I asked to speak with her manager and am currently waiting for another callback.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CA,921XX,,Consent provided,Web,04-06-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2421964

Instead of them reading the paperwork and acknowledging that it was a settlement offer from my first mortgage they removed me from their hardship program. I had to call them several times and have requested that they respond to the correspondence that was sent to them and advised myself and my first mortgage if they are going to accept the settlement offer. Since I sent the correspondence I have been assigned several representatives. The last one assigned to me XXXX, I sent her an email on XX/XX/XXXX to find out the status of the settlement offerr. She called me on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and stated that she did not know the status but she would reach out to the processor and would call me back in 24 to 48 hours. It has been 8 business days since I spoke with her and have received no response. I also sent her an email for status on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and no response as of this date.

After receiving confirmation that the auto pay was accepted i then found out that, due to data entry on the credit card company 's, part they did not accept my bank account number. They called me and told me there was a problem with the auto pay and my bank account was not accepted. They then told me to go back online and reconfirm that the data was correct. After i confirmed that my information was correct and paid the minimum amount due, the next month i received a statement telling me that only the minimum amount was due in the amount of {$30.00}. I then, at the same month and time frame received a recorded phone call from the company telling me i am delinquent on my account. When i called to inquire about the situation they told me again that my bank account was not accepted, that i was over the limit and also three months behind on my payments. 

I once again whet online to only confirm once again that my information was correct. I aslo confirmed that they discontinued my card and reported me for late payment to the three major credit report agencies. 

Also, after i paid the late amount and total amount due that was behind, the next day i was informed by the auto phone with the company that i was still late. When i asked and inquired if they reported me for no fault of my own, the response was they were having problems with there computer system. 

I would like to report three accounts of fraud : 1. Sending a false or inaccurate monthly statement that stated only the minimum amount was due when they then informed me that i was three months in the rears. 
2. Reporting me to the credit report agencies for late payment when they admitted they were having problems with there computer system and the error was clearly on their part. 
3. Misuse of personnel information : my bank account number and intentional data entry error and/or gross negligence, in attempt to collect more money by falsifying the amount do with the intention to collect more money from me.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,WA,980XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-05-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2372062

03-06-2017,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"We closed on our loan in XX/XX/2015. A short time later it was sold and started to be serviced by Ditech. That was the beginning of the worst customer service experience of my life. When our property taxes were due, I checked my account and saw that they were not being paid. Of course, the money had been escrowed on time but no payment was being made for taxes. I sent an email to their customer service to find out what was happening. I got a standard letter within a week telling me they would look into it and I could expect an answer within 30 days. I tried waiting patiently but as I checked my account with the town, I saw interest starting to be added because the payment was so late. So, this time I called the customer service number and after being transferred a few times spoke with someone in that department. 

The rep told me that they were n't being paid because my town needed to send them something to prompt payment and once that happened, they would be paid. So I checked with my town and they told me the same thing was sent to Ditech that is sent to all other mortgage servicing companies. Here we go. I call Ditech again and have to start all over as they do n't seem to have record of my previous inquiries. What happens next? I get another form letter exactly like the last one telling me they will look into it. Still no tax payment and interest keep getting added. Again, I try to wait but my husband ends up calling and finds out that from who he talked to that the problem was that our account was not set up correctly. It was marked as a "" self-pay '' for taxes even though they have been collecting our money for escrow every month. OK, so mistakes happen, I just wanted it fixed and to get those taxes paid as we were now a few months late. 

I contacted the town again and told them what was happening and they told me they would let me know once they received payment. Great. Payment was finally made but Ditech used my escrow money to pay the interest that had accrued from being so late!!! What?? They made an administrative error in setting up our account yet they used our money to correct their error? That is just unacceptable. So, my husband called again and the rep he spoke with that time told him she saw everything in their system and she would put the request in to refund us the money taken from our account to pay the interest. Great, that is all I wanted. Weeks go by and nothing. 

Finally, my husband called back and they said the request was denied. Seriously??? So I sent one final email because I wanted it in written form and told them how miserable their customer service was and that I would give them 14 days to make this right or I would begin to explore other avenues to file a complaint. What do I get? Another form letter to tell me they would look into and I would have a response within 30 days. That was in late XX/XX/XXXX and it is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have gotten no refund and no response. They have got to be the absolute worst in customer service I have ever seen. It is unfortunate you can not choose who services your loan because if you could, I would not go near this company ever again.",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,Ditech Financial LLC,NH,030XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-06-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2374252
